npm full form - 
  npm does not have a full form
  it is everything but node package manager

npm is a standard repositories for all the packages
  all the libs and utils are hosted over npm

  npm init
    generates package.json
      package.json is a configuration for npm
      why package.json?
  
  what is a bundler?
    bundler makes our app prod ready
    our code needs to be cleaned, compressed, cached, minified,
      bundled before it can be sent to prod
    ex: webpack, parcel,  vite

  npm install -D parcel
    two types of dependencies:  
      devDependencies:
        indicated by -D
        required for development phase
      normalDependencies: 
        used in prod as well

  caret vs tilde in dependencies
    "parcel": "^2.10.0"
    ^ upgrades automatically updates the dependency to the minor version
      ie, 2.10.0 to 2.10.11
    ~ automaticallyupdates the dependency to the major version
      ie, 3.1.0
    ^ is safer than ~

  package-lock.json
    push package.json and package-lock.json to git

    keeps a track of exact version of the dependency being installed
    (unlike package.json which has approx versions with ^ and ~)

    also contains transitive dependencies
      ie, dependencies of the dependencies that we install
      these dependencies(here, parcel) will have their own package.json,
        using which parcel will find out what the transitive dependencies are

    integrity: hash to verify that the same version in the machine is being
      deployed to production
    
  node_modules
    also contains transitive dependencies
      ie, dependencies of the dependencies that we install
      these dependencies(here, parcel) will have their own package.json,
        using which parcel will find out what the transitive dependencies are

    don't push node_modules to prod, should go in gitignore,
      as it can be recreated at any time on any machine with the help of
      package.json and package-lock.json


  igniting app:
    npx is used to temporarily download packages from internet and execute it
    npm only downloads packages, and does not run it, and npm requires 
      all of its dependencies to be mentioned in package.json, unlike npx
    
    npx parcel index.html
      hosts our app into local server

    CDN links is not a good way to install react and react-development
      npm with package.json is the good way because:
        1: auto updates
        2: no network call to cdn everytime, will be in node_modules
      
      npm install react
      npm install react-dom
    
    error: react undefined error
      import react and reactDOKM into App.js

    error: browser scripts cannot have imports or exports
      add type="module" to our script tag
      <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>
      update react-dom import to react-dom/client

Parcel responsibilities: 
  - dev build
  - local server
  - HMR: Hot module repacement: 
    auto update app
    file watching algo written in c++
  - faster builds via caching
  - image optimization
  - bundling
  - minification
  - compression
    remove all white spaces from code
  - consistent hashing
  - code splitting
    splitting files
  - differential bundling
    to support older browsers
  - diagnostics
  - error handling
  - https hosting
  - tree shaking
    remove unused code
  - different dev and prod builds
    for creating prod build
      npx parcel build index.html
        remove main from package.json to fix error
      prod build has 3 files:
        js, html, and compressed


all of these makes our app faster, not just react alone.
bundlers play a huge role in highly performant apps.

dist folder
  goes in gitignore as these temp folders can be recreated with 
    npx parcel build
  dev or prod builds are stored in dist folder
  
making app compatible for older version of browsers 
  use browserslist
    npm package needs configuration
    "browserslist": [
      "last 10 Chrome versions",
      "last 2 Firefox versions"
      "last 2 versions"
    ]
    can also give query composition which are country and device specific
